My name is Laila Walker and I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying computer science and data science at UC Berkeley. After working as an educator and software engineering intern, I became interested in Human-Computer Interaction and software engineering. I am in the process of applying for graduate programs around the country.

Teaching
======
**Bluestamp Engineering** 

[Bluestamp](https://bluestampengineering.com/) is a teaching start up based in Palo Alto. As an instructor, I was resposibility for the design and success of three student projects: a smart mirror, an Amazon Alexa for home automation, and a hummingbird detection program. 

**UC Berkeley College of Engineering**

In Berkeley's COE, I worked as a design assistant for the Pre-Engineering Program, preparing students for introductory coding classes and teaching them fundamental electrical engineering skills. After program completion, I worked as a tutor for Berkeley's introductory Python course, CS61A for six months.

Research Experience
======
Since July, I have been working as a lab assistant for the [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/) at UC Berkeley. I helped conduct research on programmers' interactions with unframiliar abstractions in computer science, investigating which tools and interfaces are the most useful when programmers interact with new libraries.

After project completion, I helped co-author a paper that was submitted to CHI 2024.
