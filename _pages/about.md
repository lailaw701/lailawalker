My name is Laila Walker and I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying computer  and data science at UC Berkeley! After working as an educator and software engineering intern, I became interested in Human-Computer Interaction and software engineering. 

My goal is to create tools and interfaces that make programming easier for newer and more experienced programmers alike. This became an interest of mine after working as an instructor for several engineering programs in the past and working as a software engineering intern twice. I want to make the world of tech more comfortable for everyone with an emphasis on people of color. I am in the process of applying for graduate programs across the country.

Teaching
======
**Bluestamp Engineering** 

[Bluestamp](https://bluestampengineering.com/) is a teaching start up based in Palo Alto. As an instructor, I was resposibility for the design and success of three student projects: a smart mirror, an Amazon Alexa for home automation, and a hummingbird detection program. 

**UC Berkeley College of Engineering**

In Berkeley's COE, I worked as a design assistant for the Pre-Engineering Program, preparing students for introductory coding classes and teaching them fundamental electrical engineering skills. After program completion, I worked as a supplemental tutor for students in the program supporting Berkeley's introductory Python course, CS61A.

Research Experience
======
Since July, I have been working as a lab assistant for the [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/) at UC Berkeley. I helped conduct research on programmers' interactions with unframiliar abstractions in computer science, investigating which tools and interfaces are the most useful when programmers interact with new libraries.

After project completion, I helped co-author a paper that was submitted to CHI 2024.
